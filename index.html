                <p>Build they did, the ancient Egyptians&mdash;beginning about 3000 B.C. and continuing with only periodic disruptions for more than three millennia. So prodigiuous were they, and so substantial their creations, that the valley of the Nile endures today as an open air museum filled with pyramids an tombs, temples an chapels, obelisks and colossi.</p>
                <p>To put up structures on the scale of the pyramids, the Egyptians had to mobilize, feed, and administer a huge labor force. Recent excavation of the graves of pyramid workers reveals that some were missing limbs or had damaged spines &mdash;the human cost of a national compulsion to glorify gods an deify the soul of kings.</p>

                Superlative emblems of the quest for immortality, the pyramid tombs at Giza (bellow) went up at the command of the Dynasty IV kings, who worshiped the sun god, Re. <br> <br>
                Pyramids may have represented eternal shafts of sunlight or symbolized the mythical mound of creation. some scholars now believe that the pyramid form had evolved much earlier, not in royal circles but as part of the religion of the common people. <br> <br>
                The Great Pyramid of Khufu (Cheops) was built 755 feet square and 481 feet tall&mdash;the world's largest stone edificie. khufu's funerary complex includes a mortuary temple, four small subsidiary pyramids, five pits for his royal boats, and a valley temple, identified in 1990. <br>Only Khafre's (chephren's) pyramid retains part of the original casing of gleaming white limestone.

                <summary>PYRAMIDS</summary>
                Most of the dozens of Old Kingdom pyramids rise on the west bank near ancient Memphis. About 2630 B.C. Imhotep, architect to King Djoser (Dynasty III), masterminded the Step Pyramid at Saqqara. Possibly the worlds's oldest freestanding stone structure, this pyramid cnsists of six tiers ato a mastaba, or low, oblong tomb, faced with cut stone. King Snefru probably built the Maidum pyramid; about 2600 B.C. he put up the Bent and Northern Stone pyramids at Dahsur, other forerunners of the true pyramids at Giza. The tombs of Unis, Pepei I, and other Old Kingdom rulers contain the Pyramid Texts&mdash;hieroglyphic incantations to ensure the king's immortality.
